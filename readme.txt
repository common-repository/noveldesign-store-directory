The Novel Design Store Directory (NDSD) is a plugin solution to enable the listing of stores or items in an easy-to-use directory system.

== Description ==

The Novel Design Store Directory was created by a development team who has been working in the online retail industry since 2008 and required an easy-to-use directory system for an ever changing and demanding industry requiring ‘on the fly’ changes for shop listings on retail websites.

== Licensing ==

The Novel Design Store Directory [NDSD] plugin is now freely available for personal use and no longer needs a license key to function. A 'PRO' version of the NDSD plugin will be created in the future with new features and additional options. 

== Support ==

Contact hello@joshuawolfe.co.uk for any support queries.

== Shortcode ==

Use the shortcode [tradinghours] in template or on a page to display the 'Trading Hours'. The hours can be set in the settings tab with an option to hide / display.

== Installation ==
